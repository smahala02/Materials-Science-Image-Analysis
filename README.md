## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the **image analysis** of materials science data. It covers key concepts such as:
- **Particle diameter measurement**: Using image analysis techniques to determine the size and distribution of particles in a material.
- **Scalebar calibration**: Applying scale bars to images for accurate spatial measurements.

The data has been generated from real experiments and is analyzed using Python scripts and image processing techniques.

## Particle Diameter Analysis

The particle diameter analysis focuses on measuring the equivalent diameters of particles from images and calculating their distribution. The data provided in `diameter.txt` contains the equivalent diameters for multiple particles.

Here is an excerpt from `diameter.txt`:
```
# Particle  --  Equivalent diameter
1.000000-----------39.493271
2.000000-----------98.019720
6.000000-----------26.986905
14.000000-----------4.068429
...
```
Explore the full data here: [diameter.txt](./diameter.txt).

## Scalebar and Image Calibration

The repository also contains images used for calibration, including a **scalebar** which provides a reference length of **1 Âµm**.

![Scalebar](./scalebar.png)

This scalebar is used to scale images and accurately measure particle sizes. The image `Coarse_250kx.TIF` is an example of an analyzed image file.

## Files in the Repository

- **`diameter.txt`**: Contains particle equivalent diameter data.
- **`scalebar.png`**: An image of a scalebar used for calibration.
- **`Coarse_250kx.TIF`**: An image file used for analyzing particles at 250,000x magnification.
- **`Image Analysis for Materials Science.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that contains Python code for analyzing the images and calculating particle diameters.
